    <h1>Highway to Extinction: MoDOT Officials Tied to Dinosaur "Research" Scam, Phantom Railroad Project</h1>
    <h2>By Sheila Mott | Senior Correspondent | Published: May 22, 2025</h2><p><strong>JEFFERSON CITY, MO</strong> — In what experts are calling one of the most bizarre misappropriation scandals in state history, a joint investigation by <em>The Missouri Mirror</em> and whistleblower files obtained through the Freedom of Information Act has uncovered that several Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) officials may have funneled over <strong>$47.8 million</strong> into a covert operation posing as "prehistoric infrastructure research"—allegedly to resurrect dinosaurs and build a cross-state <em>Jurassic Rail Line</em>.</p>

<p>The scheme, internally dubbed <strong>Project ThunderLizard</strong>, was hidden beneath budget line items for "geological railbed surveys" and "prehistoric terrain stabilization" beginning in 2018. On paper, the funds were listed as grants for stabilizing rock beds in rural counties along a never-completed project known as the <em>Southern Ozarks Revitalization Railroad</em> (S.O.R.R.).</p>

<h3>Whistleblower Sounds Alarm</h3>
<p>"It started with a purchase order for fossil-grade refrigeration units. I asked why we were buying cryo-chambers and got told to 'stick to potholes,'" said a former MoDOT procurement officer who requested anonymity.</p>

<p>Documents show MoDOT subcontracts were issued to a defunct Montana-based lab called <em>PaleoFuture Research Initiative</em>—a company whose board of directors includes two former railroad executives and a man listed as a "dino-engineering visionary."</p>

<h3>A Railroad to Nowhere</h3>
<p>S.O.R.R., allegedly planned to run from <strong>Poplar Bluff to St. Joseph</strong>, never saw a single rail laid. Instead, field photos show a vast fenced-in excavation site outside of <strong>Mountain View, MO</strong>, where concrete pylons and blast-proof bunkers were partially constructed.</p>

<p>Internal memos from 2020 refer to a “D-Rail staging zone” and a “Velociraptor observation protocol.”</p>

<p>When questioned, MoDOT Director Henry K. Slaight denied wrongdoing, claiming the project was “experimental transit infrastructure involving simulated prehistoric topographies.” But federal investigators are less convinced.</p>

<h3>Money, Power, and Extinction</h3>
<p>A Senate inquiry revealed that at least <strong>six senior officials</strong> diverted state transportation funds for “biological reanimation studies” under the guise of rail development. One email reads, “If Kansas gets Jurassic transport before us, it’s over.”</p>

<p>A retired Union Pacific foreman came forward last week with photos showing crates labeled “LIVE CARGO – HANDLE WITH CARE” at a site in <strong>Rolla</strong>, which he says were moved at night with military escort.</p>

<p>Despite this, Governor Carla Hensley downplayed the report, stating: “While the idea of dinosaurs riding trains is fascinating, we are focused on today’s infrastructure—specifically, bridges.”</p>

<h3>What’s Next?</h3>
<p>A federal probe is underway, and subpoenas have been issued to former MoDOT officials, including Chief Budget Analyst Rick Haddleman, who mysteriously retired to an undisclosed location in Costa Rica last year.</p>

<p>As one senator quipped, “This is either the biggest misuse of funds in Missouri history, or someone’s trying to live out <em>Jurassic Park</em> with a train pass.”</p>
